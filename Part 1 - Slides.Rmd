## Relationship Between Air Temperature and Sea Temperature

## Relationship Between Air and Sea Temperatures (Cont.)

- The previous plot shows that air and sea temperatures are highly correlated, as they two follow a very similar pattern over time. In addition, the sea temperature is always above 0ÂºC and is generally higher than the air temperature each day. 

- A further check for the correlation between two variables with the following code yields the result of `r corr`, which confirms our findings from the plot.

      ```
      cor(tidy$ATMP, tidy$WTMP, use = 'complete.obs')
      ```
